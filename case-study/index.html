        <h4>Tulare Public Library Search Box</h4>
        <div class="case-study-content">
          <article>
            <p>I was approached by the Tulare Public Library, looking for custom code for their website. 
              They had previously used a search box provided by a library database company that had allowed 
              users to search either the library catalog or the library’s research databases. When their contract 
              with the company expired, the City’s IT department had copied code from another library’s website to 
              use as a replacement, which was functional but too small and not eye-catching. Library users were 
              having trouble finding it on their page and ended up searching the City’s website instead of the 
              library catalog.</p> 
              <figure>
                <img src="../assets/original-search-box.png" alt="Tulare Public Library home page with old search box">
              </figure>
              <p>The library wanted something that looked similar to the old search box from the 
              library database company. I elicited their requirements for the project and they also provided me with a 
              design comp.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="../assets/design.png" alt="Search box design comp">
              </figure>
              <p>
                I began the project by examining the code on their page. My first challenge on this project was deciding 
                how best to structure the deliverables. The existing code had the search box displaying through an iframe. 
                I assumed this was merely a relic from when they hosted the library database company’s search box and I 
                decided to eliminate the iframe to house the search box directly on the page. Library staff informed me that 
                the City’s department was not very comfortable reading or writing code, so I planned to deliver instructions 
                on how to edit the code on their page to eliminate the iframe and give them code they could copy and paste in 
                and along with the accompanying CSS file. I wrote the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS needed to create the search box
                matching the design. When I initially delivered the code and the instruction documents, 
                however, the IT department explained to library staff that the Content Management System (CMS) that they used 
                required that they use an iframe to bring custom code onto their page. So I went back to restructure my code 
                to deliver it in a separate HTML file along with new instructions for how to edit the HTML file to add the 
                correct file path for the accompanying CSS file. I also provided instructions for editing the code for the 
                iframe to be the right size to fit the search box and also how to edit the file path to the location where 
                the HTML file was saved. 
              </p>

              <p>The City’s IT department was able to successfully install the search box in May 2021. I followed up with 
                library staff who let let me know that they were happy with the end result and the search box met all of 
                their specifications.
